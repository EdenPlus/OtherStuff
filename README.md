# OtherStuff
This is a repository that basically acts as storage for stuff that doesn't come from Coding Ground. You'll find pretty much anything else I've worked on and feel like sharing will be put.

## A hub page to reach some of the stuff I've done with HTML/CSS/PHP/JavaScript
http://foothillertech.com/student/webdesign/2015/2nd/02_37/index.html I no longer have access to this site so, it may not stay up, eventually, I might add the file copies of these sites to my GitHub since they are mostly just school projects tied with me experimenting with stuff.
